# ME495 Embedded Systems Homework 4
Author: Asa Rogers

This package, `nubot_nav`, is designed to enable a simulated robot (nubot) to autonomously map and navigate an environment in the ROS 2 environment. The project integrates the `slam_toolbox` for SLAM, the `nav2` stack for navigation, and a custom exploration node to autonomously explore unknown spaces. This README provides instructions for setup, execution, and descriptions of the implemented functionalities.
